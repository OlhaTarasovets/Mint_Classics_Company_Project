## 2. Inventory vs. Sales
### Product Performance
#### *Fast-moving vs. Slow-moving*:
  -	North (62%) and East (75%) warehouses store the highest proportion of slow-moving items.
  -	South (leaner inventory) has a more balanced stock distribution.

#### *Sales by Product Line*:
  -	Classic Cars (34%) and Vintage Cars (22%) account for over half of total sales.
  -	Planes, Motorcycles, and Trucks & Buses contribute smaller shares.
## 3. Recommendations
### Warehouse Optimization
#### *Consider closing the South warehouse*:
  -	While it has a high turnover ratio, it has the lowest overall revenue and profit.
  -	Its lower stock-to-demand ratio suggests it can be absorbed into other warehouses.

#### *Inventory Redistribution*:
  -	Transfer excess stock from the East warehouse to other locations to optimize storage space.
  -	Reduce slow-moving inventory in the North and East warehouses.
### Product Line Adjustments

-	Phase out low-demand items: Slow-moving products in the North and East warehouses should be considered for discontinuation.

-	Optimize fast-moving products: Prioritize stocking Classic Cars and Vintage Cars in warehouses with high demand.

## 4. Conclusion
By closing the South warehouse and optimizing inventory across the remaining facilities, Mint Classics Company can maintain efficient operations while reducing costs. Redistribution of overstocked items and eliminating slow-moving products will further improve efficiency and profitability.
